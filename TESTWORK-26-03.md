## Problem

Business shaman came to you and said he needs a web application that lists out all the airports in Norway.
Business shaman says it is also important to see next 5 departures for the airport if you chose to select it.
It is up to you to make a nice design for it as Figma shaman is on sick leave.

## Requirements

1. Application must be done in Angular _[1]_
2. The data must come from Airlabs API _[2]_
3. App must have more than 1 page
4. It should look nice, use whatever component/UI library you like
5. Your code must be stored in remote Git repository.

## Bonus

1. Show the airports on the map, you can use Google Maps for it _[3]_ or something else what you know/like.
2. Selected airport should be focused on the map
3. Translations - make your app support more than 1 language
4. Write some tests for the app, test must be meaningful
5. Accessibility - high contrast, keyboard navigation etc
